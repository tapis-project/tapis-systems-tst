Schema updates pre-flyway
-------------------------------------
Procedure for modifying the DB schema before moving to use of incremental migrations using flyway.
1. Make changes in lib/src/main/resources/db/migration/V001__init.sql
2. Make changes in Dao implementation. Be sure to update for tables and columns that have been renamed or removed.
     Or proceed with steps 3,4,5 and see what compile failures happen, then make updates.
3. Make sure local DB is up and lib/pom.xml has correct jdbc url, username and password
4. Use sql in lib/src/main/resources/sql/reset_db.sql to reset the schema
5. Run the maven profile to re-create the schema and generate/update the jooq source code:
   a. cd lib
   b. mvn clean install -Pdb-update
6. If necessary fix any compile errors (such as in the Dao) and then you should be able to run a top level
   mvn clean install.
7. Using "git status" you should be able to see the updates to the jooq source code.
8. Make other updates as needed for Dao and service layers. For example, if columns added this is the time
   to start adding the new model attributes to the code.
